# Customer Analysis and Prediction 
## Problem Statement
Insights into User Activity ERP systems collect detailed data on user 
activity by logging their actions within the system. Below, I present an analysis of sample data on registered users, 
utilizing Power BI tools to visualize and understand this information. Additionally, Process Mining visualization has 
been incorporated into the analysis to illustrate the sequences 
of steps taken by users within the system.
